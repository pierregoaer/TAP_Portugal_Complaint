# The TAP Portugal incident 

In November 2019, I booked round-trip tickets with TAP Portugal to fly from Toronto to Paris with a layover in Lisbon. The flights were scheduled for April 2020.

As we know, Covid-19 hit around mid-March, 2020 and on March 26, 2020, TAP Portugal cancelled my flights. Well over 2 years later, the airline still hasn't refunded me and is borderline impossible to reach for customer support. It's gotten so out of hands, that Facebook groups were created by angry customers that, just like me, have been waiting for a refund for way too long now.

After interacting with numbers of passengers that have been wronged by the company, a list of email addresses were created. These emails are from TAP employees and other emails found online (forum, their company website, ...). This gave me the idea to write a script that will email each recipient on this list, hoping that someone, at some point, would respond and help solve my case.
It also includes a 1MB pdf attached, hoping that if I email them enough, their inboxes would start filling up. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a little project I wish I didn't have to do but sadly this airline has made it clear that great customer experience is not part of their core values.

Interestingly enough, during the same time period, I had other flights booked with Air France and Air Canada. Both these airlines refunded me within days of cancelling the flights due to the pandemic... Over 2 years later, TAP still hasn't.

PS: I am not trying to cause any harm with this project. I simply want to raise awareness that companies cannot treat customers this way and get away with it. This represents millions of dollars that the company is simply stealing from travelers that trusted them to fly somewhere, it is unacceptable.
